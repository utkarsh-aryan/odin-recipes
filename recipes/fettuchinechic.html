    <h3>Ingredients Required</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
      <li>1 sprig chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps Required</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1: </strong><p>
        Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low; 
        simmer for 5 minutes. Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15 minutes.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 2: </strong><p>
        Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle,
         cut into bite-size slices.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 3: </strong><p>
        Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 4: </strong><p>
        Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth; bring to a simmer and remove from heat.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 5: </strong><p>
        Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly incorporated;
         repeat until about 1/2 cup of the warm cream mixture is used.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 6: </strong><p>
        Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly
        , until the mixture almost comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 7: </strong><p>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly cooked through, 
        about 7 minutes. Drain.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 8: </strong><p>
        Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until thick.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Step 9: </strong><p>
        Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to serve.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
